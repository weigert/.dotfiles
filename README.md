custom linux setup

I use Openbox on Ubuntu 18.

The programs I use are listed below. Relevant configurations are typically stored in ~/.config (the files in this repo).

## Programs

Visual:

    compton           - compository
    feh               - background setting
    rofi              - program launcher
    polybar           - display bar
    
Workflow:
    
    nautilus          - file manager
    gnome-terminal    - terminal
    firefox           - browser
    evince            - pdf viewer
    code editor       - atom
    screen recorder   - simplescreenrecorder
    scan tool         - simplescan
    video player      - vlc
    music player      - spotify + sp
    
I am not entirely happy with nautilus, because it doesn't adhere to my theme fully. But it works well. I am looking for alternatives.

Evince is nice because it is clean and *it just works*.
